<h2 class="Estilo5">Improved Algorithm for the Semi-Aliveness Verification Criterion<a name="algorithm"></a> </h2>
<p align="justify" class="Estilo5">In case  all variables are Boolean (in the variability and context models), it is even possible to propose an improved algorithm for the Semi-aliveness verification criterion. Instead of asking the solver for several solutions (until two solutions differ on at least one context variable and one variability variable), it is possible to find the first solution of a unique Constraint Satisfaction Problem (CSP). This CSP consists on two sub-CSPs: the original one and its mirror. </p>
<p align="justify" class="Estilo5">The set of variables in the mirror CSP is a renaming of the set of the original variables: V' is the mirror set of variables in the variability model and C' is the mirror set of variables in the context model. The constraints of the mirror CSP are the same as in the original CSP but are applied to the corresponding renamed variables. </p>
<p align="justify" class="Estilo5">The two sub-CSPs are linked with constraints as follows: a first constraint states that the context variables should be different in both CSPs (i.e., C != C') and similarly for the variables (i.e., V != V'). If a solution exists, then two different contexts (for a partition) entail two different variable values (i.e., two different alternatives from the variability point of view). In other words, it means that the variability model is not insensitive to context changes. Since C is a vector of variables, the constraint C != C' is TRUE if and only if there is at least one variable in C different from its mirror variable in C' (similarly for V != V'). </p>
<p align="justify" class="Estilo5">We represent the sum of C and the sum of C' as two polynomials to avoid that changes of different variables values are considered by the solver as the same change when other variables values change; in other words, to constraint the fact that the order of the Boolean variables is important. Finally, even if we duplicate the size of the problem, we only need one request to the solver (the first solution that is found is enough).</p>
<p align="justify" class="Estilo5"> The algorithm is described as follows:</p>
<blockquote>
  <p align="justify" class="Estilo8">semiAliveness_boolean(Variability Model VM, Context Model CM, Solver S){<br>

<h2 class="Estilo5">Framework Demonstration<a name="video"></a></h2>
<p align="justify" class="Estilo5">We  created a video demonstration of our proposed framework for the dynamic adaptation of service compositions with variability models. In this demonstration, MoRE-WS uses a variability model to guide two dynamic adaptations in our non-trivial running example when the <em>B&amp;NUnavailable</em> and the <em>UPSHiExecTime</em> context conditions are fulfilled in a tight time frame. <span class="Estilo6">NOTICE:</span> <strong>In order to watch this video on HD, please open it directly on <a href="https://vimeo.com/61633712" target="_blank">Vimeo</a>.</strong>

<h2 class="Estilo5">Details of the Experiment Related to GQM Model 1 and GQM Model 2 <a name="GQM1and2" id="GQM1and2"></a></h2>
<p class="Estilo5"><strong>GQM model 1</strong> has the following goal: &ldquo;Efficient generation time of variability model configurations from the systems analyst&rsquo;s viewpoint.&rdquo; This model has the following related research question (<strong>Q1</strong>): &ldquo;What is the required time to generate the adaptation space?&rdquo;</p>
<p class="Estilo5"><strong>GQM model 2</strong> has the following goal: &ldquo;Reduce the complexity of the adaptation space from the systems analyst's viewpoint.&rdquo; This model has the following related research question (<strong>Q2</strong>): &ldquo;Do a small variability model and a set of resolutions can be used to describe a large adaptation space?&rdquo;</p>
<p class="Estilo5">In order to answer Q1 and Q2, we carried out an experiment using the variability model in our running example with 36 features and nine resolutions. <a href="http://www.pros.upv.es/m4spl/index.html" target="_blank"><strong>MOSKitt4SPL</strong></a> files that were used in this experiment can be downloaded <strong><a href="MoRE_WS_Full_Case.zip" target="_blank">here</a></strong>. This compressed file contains the variability model, the resolutions and the generated adaptation space (described as a state machine). Please decompress it and import the decompressed folder into the workspace of MOSKitt4SPL.</p>
<p align="justify" class="Estilo5">The following  MOSKitt4SPL's screenshots show the set  of resolutions that were executed. Each resolution has a unique identifier ID, where ID = 1...9:</p>
